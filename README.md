# Reading Tracker

A personal reading tracker that helps users record books, track reading progress, write notes, and write summaries.

## Features

- Upload PDF version of the book to add books.
- Track current page and reading percentage, time and date of reading.
- Selecting quotes and write side notes for each book
- Writing summary of the book

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Django
- Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

The current frontend pages are located in `frontend/`. The Django backend in `backend/` serves those pages, stores book metadata, exposes the API, and saves uploaded PDFs under `backend/uploads/pdfs/`. The root `index.html` redirects to the dashboard page for easier direct opening and deployment.

## Run Locally

From the project root, start the app with:

```bash
make install
make run
```

Use `make install` the first time to install backend dependencies. `make run` serves the app and API together at `http://localhost:8000`.

If you prefer to run Django manually:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd backend
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```

If port `8000` is already busy, use another port such as `8002`.

Then open:

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:8000/`
- Shelf: `http://localhost:8000/shelf.html`
- Notes: `http://localhost:8000/notes.html`
Uploaded PDFs are saved to `backend/uploads/pdfs/`, book metadata is stored in `backend/db.sqlite3`, and PDF pages are opened with PDF.js. After upload, each PDF appears as a selectable book on the Shelf page. The Shelf filters use saved progress: To read is page 1, Reading is between page 1 and the final page, and Completed is the final page.

If the backend is not running, the frontend falls back to browser IndexedDB storage. That fallback is separated by origin, so `http://localhost:8000/` and `http://localhost:8002/` have different local browser libraries.
