# Reading Tracker

A personal reading tracker that helps users record books, track reading progress, write notes, and write summaries.

## Features

- Upload PDF version of the book to add books.
- Track current page and reading percentage, time and date of reading.
- Selecting quotes and write side notes for each book
- Writing summary of the book

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Django
- Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

The current frontend pages are located in `frontend/`. The root `index.html` redirects to the dashboard page for easier opening and deployment. The `backend/` folder is prepared for the future Django implementation.

## Run Locally

Install and start the Django backend first:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd backend
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver 8010
```

In a second terminal, start the frontend from the project root:

```bash
cd frontend
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

If port `8000` is already busy, use another port such as `8002`.

Then open:

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:8000/`
- Shelf: `http://localhost:8000/shelf.html`
- Notes: `http://localhost:8000/notes.html`
When the backend is running, uploaded PDFs are saved to `backend/uploads/pdfs/`, book metadata is stored in `backend/db.sqlite3`, and the frontend can read the same library from any localhost frontend port. PDF pages are opened with PDF.js. After upload, each PDF appears as a selectable book on the Shelf page.

If the backend is not running, the frontend falls back to browser IndexedDB storage. That fallback is separated by origin, so `http://localhost:8000/` and `http://localhost:8002/` have different local browser libraries.
